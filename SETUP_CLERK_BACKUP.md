# Quick Clerk Setup Steps

## Current Issue
The app is trying to use Clerk but you haven't added your keys yet.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Add Clerk Keys (Recommended)
1. Go to https://clerk.com and sign up
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your keys from the dashboard
4. Update `humanizer-front/.env.local`
5. Restart the dev server

### Option 2: Skip Clerk For Now
If you want to test without Clerk first, I can help you disable it temporarily and use guest mode. Just let me know!

## What I Just Added
- ✅ Sign-in page at `/sign-in`
- ✅ Sign-up page at `/sign-up`
- ✅ Guest mode with unique IDs
- ✅ Middleware configuration

Your app can now work with Clerk when you add the keys!
